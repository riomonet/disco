### Using this projecet to study state in react
- Pass event handlers down as props to child componenets
- Understand the **KEY** prop that React asks for when Mapping over data
- understanding how **useState** works
- updating and storing mutable items

---
Every time a componenet is rendered, that componenets function runs. 
**useState** allows  values of variables to persist across function calls.
React has a mechanism that mantains a table of values. The table track variables
in the component function by the order in which they are declared, not by name.
